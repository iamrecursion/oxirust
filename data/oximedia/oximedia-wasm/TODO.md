# OxiMedia WASM — Development Roadmap

**Version: 0.2.0 (active, dev branch `0.2.0`) / 0.1.9 (stable, `master`)**
**Status: 76 modules wired into `lib.rs` and exported; 3 dishonest decoder
classes removed from the public surface, plus a 4th dishonest decode path
found and fixed inside `media_player` (see "Removed" / "AV1 decode audit"
below).**

## Data-plane policy

Buffer-crossing `#[wasm_bindgen]` APIs use `Uint8Array`/`Uint8ClampedArray`
(8-bit SDR) or `Float32Array` (HDR/linear) exclusively — never
`Float64Array`. Per-packet/per-frame hot-path methods return typed structs
with getters, never JSON strings (JSON remains fine for one-shot
configuration/listing calls). All buffer-crossing APIs in this crate
conform to this policy as of 0.1.9.

## Implemented Modules

### Core decoders and muxers
- [x] `audio_decoder` — FLAC, Opus decoders (real; Vorbis removed, see "Removed")
- [x] `video_encoder` — VP8 encoder
- [x] `demuxer` — WebM/Matroska/Ogg/FLAC/WAV demuxer
- [x] `muxer` — WebM muxer
- [x] `streaming_demuxer` — streaming demux
- [x] `container` — container format helpers
- [x] `probe` — magic-byte format detection
- [x] `io` — I/O utilities
- [x] `media_player` — self-contained player (format probe/demux honest;
      `next_frame()` now errors on AV1 instead of the internal decode this
      line used to claim — see "AV1 decode audit" below)

### Analysis and quality
- [x] `analysis` — loudness (EBU R128), beat detection, spectral features
- [x] `quality_wasm` — PSNR, SSIM, frame quality
- [x] `scopes_wasm` — waveform, vectorscope, false color

### Color management
- [x] `colormgmt_wasm` — color space conversion, tone mapping, delta-E
      (`Float32Array` + `Uint8Array` `_u8` companions since 0.1.9; was `f64` before)
- [x] `hdr_wasm` — PQ/HLG transfer functions, HDR tone mapping — wired into
      `lib.rs` in 0.1.9 (previously implemented but orphaned: not declared as
      a module, so none of it was reachable or compiled into the crate).
      Buffer APIs converted `f64` → `f32` at the same time.
- [x] `lut_wasm` — 3D LUT application, photographic presets, .cube parser —
      wired into `lib.rs` in 0.1.9 (previously orphaned, same as `hdr_wasm`).
      Buffer APIs were already `f32`.
- [x] `dolbyvision_wasm` — Dolby Vision metadata
- [x] `calibrate_wasm` — color calibration

### Audio
- [x] `convert` — sample format and sample rate conversion
- [x] `convert_wasm` — format/codec conversion helpers
- [x] `mixer_wasm` — audio mixing, gain, pan
- [x] `mir_wasm` — beat/tempo/chord/key detection
- [x] `normalize_wasm` — loudness normalization with EBU R128 targets
- [x] `restore_wasm` — audio restoration, de-clip
- [x] `spatial_wasm` — Ambisonics (HOA), VBAP panning — wired into `lib.rs`
      in 0.1.9 (previously orphaned, same as `hdr_wasm`)
- [x] `audiopost_wasm` — stems, mix, delivery spec
- [x] `denoise_wasm` — audio/video denoising

### Graphics and compositing
- [x] `graphics_wasm` — broadcast graphics, templates
- [x] `vfx_wasm` — effects, chroma key, transitions
- [x] `image_wasm` — image ops, DPX/EXR, histograms
- [x] `multicam_wasm` — multi-camera compositing
- [x] `scaling_wasm` — video/image scaling

- [x] `subtitle_wasm` — SRT/VTT/ASS parsing and conversion
- [x] `captions_wasm` — captions processing
- [x] `timecode_wasm` — SMPTE timecode operations

### Production and workflow

      and `oximedia_packet_to_encoded_chunk` return typed
      `WasmVideoDecoderConfig` / `WasmEncodedChunkInfo` structs (0.1.9;
      previously hand-formatted JSON strings on a per-packet hot path)

## Removed (0.1.9): dishonest decoders

Three decoder classes were removed entirely from the WASM surface because
their implementations did not do what their names promised:

- [x] ~~`video_decoder` — `WasmVp8Decoder`~~ removed: the underlying VP8
  decoder returned `Err` on every `decode_frame()` call.
- [x] ~~`av1_decoder` — `WasmAv1Decoder`~~ removed: returned `Ok` with
  YUV buffers that were never actually populated with decoded pixels.
- [x] `audio_decoder::WasmVorbisDecoder` removed: only round-trips its own
  synthetic test format, not real Ogg Vorbis bitstreams.

Native VP8/AV1 decoders in `crates/oximedia-codec` and Vorbis in
`crates/oximedia-audio` are untouched (this was a WASM-surface-only change);
the corresponding Cargo features (`vp8` on `oximedia-codec`, `vorbis` on
`oximedia-audio`) were dropped from this crate's `Cargo.toml` since nothing
here uses them anymore.

## AV1 decode audit (0.1.9, later pass): `media_player` had the same bug

This "Removed" section previously claimed `WasmMediaPlayer` "still performs
real AV1 decode internally," as a contrast with the removed `WasmAv1Decoder`.
That claim was false — verified by reading `crates/oximedia-codec`'s
`Av1Decoder` end to end:

- `Av1Decoder::send_packet` → `decode_temporal_unit` parses OBU/frame headers
  and pushes a `VideoFrame::allocate()`d buffer (all-zero planes) onto its
  output queue. The `TileGroup` OBU case is a no-op (see the comment at the
  call site: "Tile group data would be processed here. For now, we've
  already created the frame in FrameHeader handling").
- `decode_frame_with_pipeline` / `decode_tiles` / `decode_superblocks` /
  `decode_block` / `decode_block_coefficients` — the real tile/coefficient/
  reconstruction pipeline — exist in the same file but are **never called**
  from `send_packet`'s path (dead code; `#![allow(dead_code)]` at the top of
  the module is why this compiled warning-free).
- `receive_frame()` therefore returns `Ok(Some(frame))` with unpopulated
  (solid-black) pixel data — bit-for-bit the same defect `WasmAv1Decoder` was
  removed for.

`oximedia-wasm/src/media_player.rs` wrapped this same `Av1Decoder` and
returned its fake frames to JS as `Ok(Some(yuv_buffer))`, unlike the direct
`WasmAv1Decoder` binding which had already been removed. Fixed to match:
the AV1 branch (the `av1_decoder` field, its construction, and the
`decode_frame_with_pipeline`-adjacent copy path) was removed from
`WasmMediaPlayer`; `next_frame()` now returns
`Err("AV1 decode is not supported in the browser build; use WebCodecs
VideoDecoder")` for an AV1-coded video track instead of a frame. Format
probing/`media_info()` is unaffected (still assumes AV1 for Matroska/MP4 per
the existing "common profile" heuristic — that's a probing simplification,
not a decode claim). The now-unreachable `PlayerState::Playing` state (only
ever set by the fake AV1 decode success path) was removed from the state
machine along with it. A regression test
(`test_next_frame_av1_track_errors`) asserts `next_frame()` errors rather
than returning a frame for an AV1 track.

## Dependency hygiene (0.1.9)

- [x] Removed unused `oximedia-stabilize`, `oximedia-imf`, `oximedia-aaf`,
  `oximedia-analytics` dependencies from `Cargo.toml`. Their corresponding
  `*_wasm.rs` modules (`stabilize_wasm`, `imf_wasm`, `aaf_wasm`,
  `analytics_wasm`) are hand-rolled browser-side implementations that never
  called into those crates (verified via `oximedia_stabilize::` /
  `oximedia_imf::` / `oximedia_aaf::` / `oximedia_analytics::` grep — zero
  hits in `src/`). The modules themselves are unchanged and still exported.
- [x] Removed a vestigial `format!("/tmp/oximedia_qc_wasm_{}.bin", ...)` dead
  path construction in `qc_wasm.rs` (WASM has no file system; the value was
  never used for I/O).
- [x] `[package.metadata.wasm-pack.profile.release] wasm-opt` changed from
  `false` to `["-Oz"]` (was shipping unoptimized release `.wasm`).

## npm packaging honesty (0.1.9)

- [x] `@cooljapan/oximedia` (bundler target of *this* crate) is the only npm
  package this crate publishes. `build.sh`/`build-dev.sh`/`npm-publish.yml`
  no longer rename `pkg-web`/`pkg-node` to `@cooljapan/oximedia` — they keep
  wasm-pack's default scoped name (`@cooljapan/oximedia-wasm`) and are
  documented as unpublished build artifacts.
- [x] README no longer advertises `@cooljapan/oximedia-web` /
  `@cooljapan/oximedia-node` as installable packages of this crate.
  `@cooljapan/oximedia-web` now belongs to the separate `/web` package
  (four WebCodecs-adjacent modules, independently versioned/published);
  README points browser users there.

## Pending Modules (future work)

- [ ] `hdr_wasm` extensions — HDR scene analysis, CUVA/VIVID metadata
- [ ] `lut_wasm` extensions — ACES pipeline, Hald CLUT round-trip
- [ ] `spatial_wasm` extensions — HRTF binaural rendering, room simulation
- [ ] Real VP8/AV1/Vorbis WASM decoders, if/when the underlying
  `crates/oximedia-codec` (VP8/AV1) and `crates/oximedia-audio` (Vorbis)
  decoders are made to actually decode real bitstreams end-to-end. Do not
  re-add `WasmVp8Decoder`/`WasmAv1Decoder`/`WasmVorbisDecoder` until then.
